## Contribute
The app is undergoing a redesign that will bring a bunch of new features including probability of precipitation, wind, UV index, sunrise/sunset times, and more. This requires a significant refactoring of the codebase which will affect most architectural layers. 

Because of this, please do not open PRs for new features now. Only bugfixes will be accepted.
